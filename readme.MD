## Cat Clicker

This is a project built when I learn udacity course [Javascript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989). First without any design patterns, then incrementally using model-view-octopus(control) pattern, finally implementing it with KnockoutJS organizational library.

### The requirements

The requirements of this project are changing all the time, first only one picture and a number of clicks, then more pictures, then detailed view, then list of pictures and clicks and detailed view, finally an admin panel, and also using MVC design pattern.
